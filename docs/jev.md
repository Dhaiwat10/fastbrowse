# Jev: what Typesafe documents, and what fastbrowse assumes

Every Jev assumption in fastbrowse, checked against Typesafe's own documentation (September 2026, Jev
1.13). Anything the documentation does not state is marked **ours**: a fastbrowse choice, tuned on the
evals rather than taken from Typesafe.

## The contract

| | Documented | Where fastbrowse relies on it |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Direct API | `POST https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone`, bearer key, body `{model, state, questions}`; response `{model, answers, usage}` ([API](https://docs.typesafe.ai/api), [OpenAPI](https://api.typesafe.ai/openapi.json)) | `clients/typesafe.py`, used when `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is set, unless `FASTBROWSE_JEV_SOURCE=gateway` |
| Gateway | Model `typesafe-ai/jev` via `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v4/ai/evaluation-model`, body `{state, questions}` ([Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/modalities/evaluation), [transport source](https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/main/packages/gateway/src/gateway-evaluation-model.ts)) | `clients/vercel.py`, used with `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`; `FASTBROWSE_JEV_BASE_URL` retargets either |
| Yes/no (Noul) | Direct returns `{type: "noul", noul: P(yes)}`; the gateway returns `probability`. Optional `true`/`false` criteria define the boundary ([Noul](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/noul), [v1 migration](https://docs.typesafe.ai/migrating-to-v1)) | `clients/validation.py` decodes each shape separately |
| Choice | The top `choice`, every option's probability, and a `confidence` ([Choice](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/choice)) | `policy.py` (operation and target), `retrieval.py` (field and short-fact reads) |
| Score | Ordered levels, returning a probability-weighted index ([Score](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/score)) | Modelled in `jev.py`, not yet called |
| Options | At most 255 per Choice ([Choice](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/choice)) | `MAX_CHOICE_OPTIONS = 255`; the 240 cap and group-then-element selection are **ours** |
| Tokens | 32k for state plus the largest question, 64k in total ([Models](https://docs.typesafe.ai/models)) | `TokenBudget` targets 24k and 48k; the headroom and `chars_per_token = 3.0` are **ours**, because tokens are estimated locally |
| Rate limits | 1,200 requests a minute and 250k tokens a second on the direct API, subject to change ([Models](https://docs.typesafe.ai/models)); no extra gateway limit on paid tiers ([Gateway limits](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/rate-limits)) | A run makes a few requests a step, far below either |
| Errors | 400/401/403/404/422/429/5xx, with 529 for overload; retry with backoff, honouring server retry headers ([Exceptions](https://docs.typesafe.ai/sdk/python/api/exceptions)) | `post_with_retry` retries 408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504 and 529 (not the 4xx request errors) and honours `retry-after-ms` and `retry-after`, capped at 10s |
| Price | $0.042 per million input tokens; output is free ([Models](https://docs.typesafe.ai/models), [gateway catalog](https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1/models)) | `CostComponent.JEV` on the ledger |
| Latency | 70 to 500ms end to end, as advertised ([launch post](https://typesafe.ai/blog/introducing-system-one-models-and-jev)); no SLA is published | Measured through the gateway: 0.28s median and 0.62s worst over 25 policy-sized calls. The 1.5s hedge in `clients/validation.py` is **ours** |
| Streaming | Gateway evaluation does not stream ([AI SDK evaluation](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core/evaluation)) | Not needed: answers are a few numbers |

## Provider failover

With both keys set, **ours**: each run starts on `FASTBROWSE_JEV_SOURCE` (direct by default). If a retryable
HTTP status outlasts that provider's retry budget, the client repeats the evaluation through the other
provider and stays there for the rest of the run. A second outage raises; providers never alternate.
Concurrent evaluations already in flight may finish on the first provider.

Request and authentication errors, malformed answers, transport failures without a final retryable HTTP
status, and cancellation do not switch providers. One key keeps the existing retry-and-raise behaviour.
`FASTBROWSE_JEV_BASE_URL` or a nondefault `FASTBROWSE_JEV_MODEL` disables automatic failover: a backup
must not bypass a proxy or silently replace a pinned model. Default backups use their own public endpoint,
key and model (`jev-1.13.0` direct, `typesafe-ai/jev` through the gateway).

The call's time includes both providers. HTTP errors add no charge; unanswered requests that may have been
billed are estimated from the successful answer's input tokens at Jev's input price, without multiplying
the backup's own retries or hedges. Both routes reach Typesafe, so an outage there can affect both.

## Confidence is not correctness

Typesafe says Jev's probabilities are calibrated: across many answers, frequencies match the stated
probability ([primer](https://docs.typesafe.ai/introduction/machine-learning-primer)). A Choice's `confidence`
summarises how concentrated the distribution is; it is not the chosen option's probability
([Confidence](https://docs.typesafe.ai/confidence)). Noul has no separate confidence: its probability is
the answer.

Every threshold in `config.py` (`recover_below` 0.55, `done_accept_from` 0.85, `claim_problem_above` 0.70,
the 0.90 read cut in `retrieval.py`) is **ours**. None is a Typesafe recommendation. Each is set per
question on the evals, and the gates behind them (VERIFY, the claim check, the LLM fallback) mean a
miscalibrated threshold tends to cost seconds rather than a wrong answer. Not always: a completion
judged at or above `done_accept_from` skips VERIFY, so a confidently wrong DONE is not caught there.

## How the questions are written

Typesafe's guidance ([Primitives](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives), [Noul](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/noul),
[Choice](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/choice), [Jev 1.13 jaggedness](https://docs.typesafe.ai/model-jaggedness/jev-1.13)),
and where fastbrowse follows it:

- **Narrow, explicit judgments, with true/false descriptions that match the instruction.** Every Noul
  question in `verification.py` and `safety.py` carries both descriptions.
- **Concrete option boundaries, plus an escape option when coverage is incomplete.** The short-fact read
  offers "none of these", and the policy offers `escalate`.
- **Question ids are invisible to the model.** Everything the model needs is in the instruction text.
- **Batch independent questions that share one state; answers cannot see each other.** Each step is one
  request: the operation, a target for each operation, and whether the page needs a sign-in. The done check asks completion, unmet
  actions and "does the draft need rewriting" in one call.
- **Remove irrelevant state and keep arithmetic in code.** State is the redacted viewport and the notes;
  counts and comparisons go to the LLM reader.

## Not yet used

- **Structured instructions** ([Structure](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/advanced)): `jev.py`
  types instructions as strings. Structured criteria are used where they help: the tab choice passes each tab as an object.
- **Score** for graded judgments such as relevance.
- **Full Choice distributions** for trying a second-best target, rather than only the top pick
  ([hierarchical classification](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/hierarchical_classification)).

No faster Jev tier, cross-request cache or logprob access is documented.
