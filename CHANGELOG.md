# Changelog

What changed in each release, in the terms someone using fastbrowse would notice. Dates are UTC.

The version on PyPI is what these entries describe: `uvx fastbrowse@0.3.3` runs exactly the release below it.
Older entries are kept verbatim rather than rewritten as the product moves.

## 0.3.3 - 2026-09-20

- **Runs on Python 3.13.** The floor was 3.14, which an application pinned below that could not work around:
  `uv add fastbrowse` simply would not resolve. Nothing in the package needed 3.14. CI now runs the whole gate
  on 3.13 and 3.14, so the floor is exercised rather than claimed.

## 0.3.2 - 2026-09-20

- **A picture of each step, for an interface that shows a run as it happens.** `Config(step_frames=True)` puts
  a PNG of the page a step acted on onto every step event. It is off by default, because it costs a screenshot
  round trip per step. A step whose page is showing a resolved secret sends no frame: pixels cannot be masked
  the way text is.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-09-20

- **A cloud browser can run as a profile someone already signed in.** `--cloud-profile ID`,
  `run_task(cloud_profile=...)` and the MCP server's `--cloud-profile` start a Browser Use Cloud browser from
  one of that account's profiles, so a run acts as whoever set the profile up. No credential is shown to a
  model, and a local run's `--profile DIR` keeps working as before. Passing a cloud profile id to local Chrome
  is refused rather than ignored.
- **Install from PyPI.** The README opened with `git clone`, which was the only way to run fastbrowse before it
  was published and is now the contributor path. It opens with `uvx fastbrowse`.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-09-20

- **A list split across pages is read whole.** Counting or ranking over a paginated list had no path to the
  answer: a run either stopped at the step limit or finished early on page one. The reader can now say a list
  continues past the page it read, a claim from part of a list cannot close the question, and when a page has a
  single next-page link the agent follows it and reads what it opened without asking the choice model each time.
- **A click that changed nothing is not repeated.** An action that left the page as it was goes to recovery
  instead of being taken again from the same page, and fields a form will not submit without (required and
  empty, or marked invalid) are named in what the action reports.
- **An MCP server.** `fastbrowse-mcp` serves one `browse` tool over MCP, so Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor
  or any other client can hand it a task. What a calling model may do is fixed by the operator's flags: a call
  can ask for less, never more.
- **Runs on Windows.** A checkout failed before any test ran: files were read in the locale's code page, a date
  used a flag only glibc has, and Chrome was never found where its Windows installer puts it.
- Fixes found by the live suite: a run outlasts a brief provider outage, a redrawn control's twin is acted on
  rather than decided again, an empty page is drawn before it is read, a start page that never loads is tried
  again, and a finish stands when the verifier doubts only what the notes already cite.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-18

- **`--record FILE`** saves an MP4 of the tab, ending on the answer, its time and its cost.
- **Sign in with a stored login the task never mentions.** `--secret NAME=ENV_VAR` and `--bitwarden ITEM` type a
  credential on the start origin without the value entering a model's context.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-18

- First release: a browser agent that picks its next action from the controls the page actually has, with an
  LLM to plan and read, and code owning verification, safety and secrets.
