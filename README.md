**A browser agent that picks instead of generating.**

Jev chooses each action, an LLM plans and reads, and code owns verification, safety and secrets.

## Why

Most browser agents generate each action from a screenshot. fastbrowse indexes the page into
candidates and has [Jev](https://typesafe.ai), a choice model, **pick one**, so it cannot click
something that was never on the page. Every claim in an answer cites a verbatim quote from the page.

![fastbrowse signing in to a shop, adding two products, filling the shipping form and placing the order: 12 steps, 37.7s, $0.0138, shown at 2x speed](docs/assets/demo.gif)

### Against Browser Use

The same 14 answer tasks (lookups, sign-ins, checkout, Google Flights), three passes each, on the same kind of
cloud browser, run the same day under a 600s ceiling neither arm reached. Every run ended when the agent
finished, so these figures compare the agents rather than their budgets.

| | passed | cost per task | median time |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **fastbrowse** | 41/42 | **$0.0057** (median), $0.0084 mean | **21.0s** |
| Browser Use (hosted) | 42/42 | $0.41 (median), $0.53 mean | 24.8s |
| | | **71x cheaper** | 1.2x faster |

The whole suite cost $0.35 here and $22.28 there.

**Reliability is not the difference.** We are one task behind, not level: Browser Use passes every task, and
the one failure in the table is ours (`saucedemo-locked-out`, one pass of three). Cost is the difference, and
it is the whole difference.

**Where the cost difference comes from.** It grows with how much a task does: 63x on a lookup, 88x on the
checkout, 182x on the sign-ins. Jev picks each action from the controls already on the page, so a step costs a
classification rather than a generation, and a task that takes thirty steps still costs cents.

**Where it is fast, it is fast because it stops guessing.** The gap opens on the tasks with the most steps in
them, which are the ones a person actually waits on:

| task | fastbrowse | Browser Use (hosted) | |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `saucedemo-checkout` two items, a shipping form and Finish | **36.3s** | 173.9s | **4.8x faster** |
| `saucedemo-cart` sign in, find a product, add it | **25.8s** | 119.8s | **4.6x faster** |
| `saucedemo-locked-out` report the site's error rather than claim success | **35.5s** | 115.8s | **3.3x faster** |
| `internet-login` sign in and confirm the signed-in page | **18.3s** | 71.7s | **3.9x faster** |
| `practice-login` the same on another practice site | **21.2s** | 36.3s | 1.7x faster |

A plain lookup finishes in eleven to fourteen seconds (`pypi-version` 11.1s, `hn-top` 12.0s, `github-license`
12.7s), where the two arms are within about four seconds of each other and theirs is often ahead. And on
Google Flights - a date picker and a results widget, the hardest thing in the suite - theirs is nearly twice
as fast (38.5s against 71.7s), and it is the one task whose grade here wobbles run to run.

Treat the whole-suite median as the summary and the rows as the shape: the more a task does, the further
ahead this gets.

[Every run, what it cost, and how a failure is counted](docs/evals.md#head-to-head-2026-09-20).

### Why fastbrowse, against each kind of agent

- **LLM agents that generate actions** (Browser Use and similar): Jev picks each action from the controls
  that are on the page, so there is no invented selector to retry. A task costs a fraction as much (a lookup,
  $0.005 against $0.33, both measured the same day), and every claim in the answer cites a verbatim
  quote. Reliability is about the same; the cost is the difference.
- **Choice-model navigators** ([jev-ultrafast](https://github.com/browser-use/jev-ultrafast)): the same
  core technique, plus everything a real task needs. fastbrowse reads pages and returns cited answers,
  signs in without showing a model the password, and stops before anything irreversible. On the six
  navigation tasks both can run, it passes 18/18 against 11/18 - though six of those seven failures ran into
  the shared 30-step limit rather than a wall, and jev-ultrafast is cheaper on all four tasks both finish.
- **Scripts:** there are no selectors to maintain. The same agent handles a date picker, a checkout and
  a search box it has never seen.

## Try it

Needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Chrome (not needed with `--cloud`); uv fetches Python itself (3.13 or newer).

```sh
export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=...   # or TYPESAFE_API_KEY, for Jev
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...   # for the LLM that plans and reads
uvx fastbrowse "What is the title of the top story right now?" --start https://news.ycombinator.com/
```

`uvx` runs the published package without installing anything. `uv tool install fastbrowse` keeps it on your
PATH, and `uv add fastbrowse` puts it in a project. Keys can live in a `.env` file in the working directory
instead of the environment; [`.env.example`](.env.example) lists every setting.

To work on fastbrowse itself:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/agent-labs-dev/fastbrowse.git && cd fastbrowse
uv sync --all-extras   # the extras carry mcp and browser_use_sdk, which the tests and evals import
cp .env.example .env
uv run fastbrowse "What is the title of the top story right now?" --start https://news.ycombinator.com/
```

```
   0 read  -> executed
complete ($0.0071, 1 steps)
The top story on Hacker News is titled "...".
```

Steps go to stderr and the answer to stdout. `--json` prints every step, the quotes behind the
answer, and cost by component.

| Flag | Effect |
|:--|:--|
| `--start URL` | the page to open first; worked out from the task when omitted |
| `--cloud` | use a [Browser Use Cloud](https://cloud.browser-use.com) browser (`BROWSER_USE_API_KEY`); far less likely to be bot-challenged. Prints a URL to watch it live |
| `--headed` | show the local Chrome window |
| `--profile DIR` | keep the local Chrome profile in `DIR`, so a site signed into there stays signed in |
| `--cloud-profile ID` | run on a Browser Use Cloud profile, signed in as whoever set it up (needs `--cloud`) |
| `--authorize` | allow submit, pay, delete and send; without it the run stops at `needs_confirmation` first |
| `--secret NAME=ENV_VAR` | let the agent type `$ENV_VAR` on the start origin; models only see `NAME` |
| `--bitwarden ITEM` | let the agent type that vault login's `username` and `password`, only where the item's saved URIs and their match detection allow |
| `--max-steps N`, `--max-dollars N` | bound the run |
| `--downloads DIR` | keep downloaded files |
| `--json` | full result instead of the answer |
| `--record FILE` | save an MP4 of the tab ending on the answer, time and cost (needs `ffmpeg`), e.g. `recordings/demo.mp4`, which git ignores. It shows what the pages showed, so watch it before sharing |

```sh
export SAUCE_PASSWORD=secret_sauce
uv run fastbrowse "Log in as standard_user with the saved password and add the backpack to the cart." \
  --start https://www.saucedemo.com/ --secret password=SAUCE_PASSWORD --authorize
```

### Signed-in sites

Sign in once by hand in a profile of its own, then point runs at it:

```sh
google-chrome --user-data-dir="$HOME/.fastbrowse/amazon" https://www.amazon.com/   # sign in, then close Chrome
uv run fastbrowse "Add a UGREEN USB-A to USB-C cable, 2m, to my cart." \
  --start https://www.amazon.com/ --profile ~/.fastbrowse/amazon --headed
```

On a cloud browser the profile lives on the [Browser Use Cloud](https://cloud.browser-use.com) account
rather than on disk, and `--cloud-profile ID` runs as it. Whoever signed that profile in did so once, in a
browser of their own; the run inherits the cookies and no model is shown a credential:

```sh
uv run fastbrowse "Add a UGREEN USB-A to USB-C cable, 2m, to my cart." \
  --start https://www.amazon.com/ --cloud --cloud-profile prof_1234
```

Or from your vault, with the [Bitwarden CLI](https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/) unlocked. Values are typed
only on a site the item's saved URIs cover, and models see only `username` and `password`:

```sh
export BW_SESSION="$(bw unlock --raw)"
uv run fastbrowse "Add a UGREEN USB-A to USB-C cable, 2m, to my cart." \
  --start https://www.amazon.com/ --bitwarden Amazon --profile ~/.fastbrowse/amazon --headed
```

### Models

The LLM defaults to `google/gemini-3.8-flash` at low reasoning effort, with
`google/gemini-3.5-flash-lite` for planning, proposing a direct address, typing field text and the
done check's verdict.
Override with `FASTBROWSE_LLM_MODEL` (every purpose), `FASTBROWSE_LLM_MODEL_<PURPOSE>` (`PLAN`,
`READ`, `FIELD_TEXT`, `SHORTCUT`, `RECOVER`, `COMPOSE`, `VERIFY`) and `FASTBROWSE_LLM_REASONING`
(`low`, `medium`, `high`).

### Results

The exit code is 0 only for `complete`.

| Status | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `complete` | every information requirement is backed by a quote, and every action is confirmed on the page |
| `unverified` | it believes it finished but could not back every claim |
| `needs_confirmation` | stopped before an irreversible action; re-run with `--authorize` |
| `needs_login` | a sign-in wall that no `--secret` covers |
| `blocked` | a bot check (a CAPTCHA) that did not clear; not a sign-in, so no secret passes it |
| `needs_input` | a field needs a value you did not give, which is never invented |
| `stuck` | recovery ran out without reaching a page state the run had not seen |
| `budget_exceeded` | a step, call, time or dollar limit was reached |
| `observation_limit` | the page has more controls than Jev can take in |
| `error` | a model or browser failure |

## How it works

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/architecture-dark.svg">
  <img src="assets/architecture.svg" alt="The task is planned and the start page opened in parallel; each step indexes the page, Jev picks an operation and target, code gates it and acts; reads keep verbatim quotes, and the answer cites every claim.">
</picture>

The LLM plans, reads and writes. Code owns the gates: irreversible actions stop without
`--authorize`, secrets reach models by name only, and cookie banners are refused before they paint.
More in [docs/design.md](docs/design.md).

## How it compares

| | hosted Browser Use | [jev-ultrafast](https://github.com/browser-use/jev-ultrafast) | fastbrowse |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Choosing an action | LLM generates from a screenshot | Jev picks from indexed controls | Jev picks from indexed controls |
| Returns | an answer | `DONE` or `BLOCKED` | an answer with quotes, or why it stopped |
| Reads pages | yes | no | yes, every claim cited |
| Signing in | yes | password fields excluded | `--secret` or a Bitwarden vault item; models see names only |
| Irreversible actions | not gated | not gated | stop unless `--authorize` |
| Browser | cloud | local Chrome, your profile | local Chrome or cloud |

jev-ultrafast is Browser Use's navigation agent (a measured 7.1s Google Flights run); fastbrowse
shares its core techniques. Its column describes `main` as of 2026-09-18.

## Embed it

`uv add fastbrowse` first, then:

```python
import asyncio

from pydantic import BaseModel

from fastbrowse import run_task
from fastbrowse.models import Limits


class Release(BaseModel):
    package: str
    version: str


async def main() -> None:
    result = await run_task(
        "Find the httpx package and report its name and latest released version.",
        start="https://pypi.org/",
        output_schema=Release,
        limits=Limits(max_dollars=0.10),
    )
    print(result.status, result.data, f"${result.cost.known_dollars:.4f}")
    for evidence in result.evidence:
        print(f'  "{evidence.quote}" from {evidence.url}')


asyncio.run(main())
```

```
complete {'package': 'httpx', 'version': '0.28.1'} $0.0114
  "httpx 0.28.1" from https://pypi.org/project/httpx/
  "pip install httpx" from https://pypi.org/project/httpx/
```

`run_task(cdp_url=...)` drives a browser that is already running, wherever it is, instead of starting one:
the run opens a tab and closes that tab, and the browser is left as it was found. With neither that nor a
cloud key, it runs local Chrome.

`RunResult.citations` is a tuple of `Citation` objects, also importable from `fastbrowse`. Each has `id`
(the number in the answer), `text` (the Notes fact), `requirement_id` (or `None`), `url`, `quote` and
`deep_link`. Each claim in `result.answer` carries numbered Markdown links to its supporting facts.
Only verified Notes facts supply citation URLs and quotes; an unknown composer reference drops its claim
and logs a warning. Facts omitted from the answer have no citation, and citation numbers can have gaps.

Deep links follow the [WICG Text Fragments syntax](https://wicg.github.io/scroll-to-text-fragment/#syntax):
`url#existing-anchor:~:text=start`. Text is percent-encoded, including hyphens, ampersands and commas.
Whitespace is collapsed for the link; `quote` keeps the verbatim capture. Quotes over 120 characters with
more than ten words use the first and last five words as `text=start,end`. An existing anchor is preserved;
an old text directive is replaced. Pages that change or require a session may no longer show the quote.

To show a run as it happens, pass `on_event=`: a `BrowserEvent` arrives first with the live-view URL of a
cloud browser, then a `StepEvent` per step. `Config(step_frames=True)` adds a PNG of the page each step acted
on, for an interface that renders the run; a step whose page is showing a resolved secret sends no frame.

Jev comes from Typesafe directly or through the Vercel AI Gateway, whichever key is set
(`FASTBROWSE_JEV_SOURCE` picks when both are, `FASTBROWSE_JEV_BASE_URL` adds a proxy). Any other source
can be passed as `run_task(jev=...)`, an object with one `evaluate(state, questions)` method; the LLM
works the same way.

## Use it from an MCP client

`fastbrowse-mcp` serves one `browse` tool over [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), so Claude Code, Claude
Desktop, Cursor or any other MCP client can hand it a task. It returns the answer, typed `fields` if asked for,
the quotes behind them, the status and what to do about it, and reports progress on every step.

```sh
claude mcp add fastbrowse -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... -e AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=... \
  -- uvx --from 'fastbrowse[mcp]' fastbrowse-mcp --max-dollars 0.25
```

For a client configured by JSON, such as Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fastbrowse": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "fastbrowse[mcp]", "fastbrowse-mcp"],
      "env": { "OPENROUTER_API_KEY": "...", "AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY": "..." }
    }
  }
}
```

The server's flags decide what a calling model may do; a call can ask for less, never more.

| Flag | Effect |
|:--|:--|
| `--cloud`, `--headed`, `--profile DIR`, `--downloads DIR` | as for the CLI, fixed for every call |
| `--cloud-profile ID` | every call runs signed in as that cloud profile; a calling model cannot choose it |
| `--allow-authorize` | let a call pass `authorize` to go through irreversible actions; without it they always stop at `needs_confirmation` |
| `--secret NAME=ENV_VAR@ORIGIN` | typed when a call's start page is on `ORIGIN` (`https://*.site.com` covers its hosts); the model sees `NAME` only |
| `--bitwarden ITEM` | a vault login a call may name in `bitwarden` |
| `--max-steps N`, `--max-dollars N`, `--max-seconds N` | ceilings per call (defaults 60, $1.00, 600s) |
| `--max-concurrent N` | runs at once, default 1; more calls wait their turn |
| `--transport http`, `--host`, `--port` | streamable HTTP at `/mcp` instead of stdio |

Over HTTP, set `FASTBROWSE_MCP_TOKEN` and every request but `GET /healthz` needs
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The server refuses to bind anything but loopback without one. A run takes
seconds to minutes, so raise the client's tool timeout if it has one (`MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` in Claude Code).

## Safety model

- **Irreversible actions.** Before any button or submit, Jev is asked whether it commits something
  that cannot be undone. Without `--authorize`, a yes stops the run. This is a classifier, not a
  guarantee: a page can word a harmful control to look harmless.
- **Secrets.** Models see secret names only. A value is resolved at the moment of typing, only for
  its declared origin, and redacted from everything the run returns. A password field is typed only
  from a stored secret, never generated.
- **Page content is data.** Every prompt says so, and completion is judged against quotes and page
  state rather than the model's say-so.

## Evals and development

```sh
uv sync --all-extras                                         # the hosted-arm SDK too, which ty checks
uv run pre-commit install                                    # ruff and ty before each commit
uv run python -m fastbrowse.evals.runner                     # local fixtures, under half a cent a task
uv run --extra browser-use python -m fastbrowse.evals.live --max-dollars 0 --concurrency 8   # live head-to-head
uv run --extra browser-use python -m fastbrowse.evals.live --arms fast              # ours alone, capped as configured
uv run --extra browser-use python -m fastbrowse.evals.live --suite heldout   # the never-debugged split
uv run ruff format . && uv run ruff check . && uv run ty check && uv run pytest
uv run python scripts/no_slop.py && uv run vale sync && uv run vale README.md docs src scripts tests
```

Grades come only from things the agent cannot write: requests the fixture server recorded, truth
from a site's own API, or the URL the browser ended on. See [docs/evals.md](docs/evals.md),
[docs/design.md](docs/design.md), and [docs/jev.md](docs/jev.md) for every Jev assumption checked against
Typesafe's documentation.
